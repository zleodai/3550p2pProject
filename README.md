TO PLAY YOU MUST HAVE TWO CLIENTS CONNECTED. RIGHT NOW TEMPORARILY ONLY FROM ONE COMPUTER BUT IT SUPPORTS PEER TO PEER NETWORKING :)

THEN YOU MUST TYPE START AND ENTER TWO TIMES ON BOTH CLIENTS

TO DRAW A CARD YOU MUST TYPE: get card

TO STAND YOU MUST TYPE: stand

TO RECIEVE UPDATES YOU MUST TYPE ping AND ENTER TWO TIMES ON BOTH CLIENTS. (SORRY THIS ONE I COULD NOT FIGURE OUT IN TIME)

HAVE FUN :)
